In this study, a real-time attention tracking system has been designed and implemented for desk-based usage scenarios. The developed system aims to analyze the user's attention state based on eye and head movements. In this context, the user's attention state is classified by jointly evaluating the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), the PERCLOS metric, and head position angles.

The system operates by detecting facial landmarks on images captured via a camera, and the obtained data is processed instantaneously. Conditions such as blinking, prolonged eye closure, and the head moving away from the screen are detected by the system to determine the user's attention state. When a loss of attention is detected, visual and auditory warnings are presented to the user.

Tests conducted during the implementation process have shown that the system can operate in real-time and produce stable results despite different user behaviors. Furthermore, the fact that the system operates using only a camera and a processor without the need for additional hardware provides a significant advantage in terms of practical use.

The obtained results demonstrate that the developed approach offers a feasible solution in the field of desk-based attention tracking. This work serves as a fundamental infrastructure for a more comprehensive final project to be carried out in the future. In future studies, the goal is to transform this into a complete system design by supporting it with more advanced analysis methods, user-specific adjustments, and different hardware components.
